### Preface

As a Computer Science student at ITB, I was introduced to computer programming through Java programming language. First, we learned the syntax of the language. Next, we have been introduced to the object-oriented approach to designing software and how to work with libraries such as Swing. Later in the third year, we learned the basics of concurrency and some design patterns for solving reoccurring problems. 

Around this time I crossed the initial steep part of the programming learning curve and I was comfortable enough with Java to learn some additional language features and Java Standard Edition platform libraries. Programming with Java became my hobby and I found a time to read additional material such as “Thinking in Java” from Bruce Eckel or “Effective Java” from Joshua Bloch.

At the same time, Oracle introduced important update number 8 to Java
platform which, among other things introduced the syntax for anonymous functions (lambdas) and a number of libraries dedicated to functional programming style, such as Stream API. I was interested in this new functionality and started to learn to implement these tools and ideas into my code. Playing with lambdas, streams, and optionals I started to realize the power and elegance behind and I got really curious about the theory behind the functional programming.

Any student trying to learn about functional programming within JVM
ecosystem will very soon become aware of programming language called Scala. The reason is that Scala has by design more richer support for functional programming than Java and hence is better suited as a vehicle for the study. At some point of the study one will become familiar with other programming languages such as Haskell or ML. There are various reasons for this, main being that these language’s syntax is designed to emphasize the functional programming ideas.

The following material is an overview of what I learned about functional
programming in the period of 2 semesters in time dedicated to honors
degree final project and my own spare time. I used Scala syntax to communicate ideas with code.
