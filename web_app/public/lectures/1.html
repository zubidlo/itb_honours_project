<p>As a Computer Science student at ITB, I was introduced to computer programming through Java programming language. First, we learned the syntax of the language. Next, we have been introduced to the object-oriented approach to designing software and how to work with libraries such as Swing. Later in the third year, we learned the basics of concurrency and some design patterns for solving reoccurring problems.</p>
<p>Around this time I crossed the initial steep part of the programming learning curve and I was comfortable enough with Java to learn some additional language features and Java Standard Edition platform libraries. Programming with Java became my hobby and I found a time to read additional material such as <code>“Thinking in Java”</code> from Bruce Eckel or <code>“Effective Java”</code> from Joshua Bloch.</p>
<p>At the same time, Oracle introduced important update 8 to Java Standard Edition platform which, among other things introduced the syntax for anonymous functions (lambdas) and a number of libraries dedicated to functional programming style. I was interested in this new functionality and started to learn to implement it into my code. By playing with <code>lambdas</code>, <code>streams</code>, and <code>optionals</code> I got really curious about the functional programming and wanted to learn more.</p>
<p>Any student who tries to learn functional programming within JVM ecosystem will very soon become aware of <code>Scala</code> programming language. The reason is that Scala has more richer support for functional programming than Java and hence is better suited as a vehicle for the study.</p>
<p>The following material is an overview of what I learned about functional programming in the period of 2 semesters. I uses Scala syntax to communicate ideas with code.</p>
