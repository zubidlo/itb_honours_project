Project Title: Play With Scala

Introduction:

In the current world of multi-core processor computers, distributed systems, and big data, we witness a paradigm shift in the computational model. The industry is moving from imperative programming and object orientation toward the more declarative functional programming style. The lack of any module dedicated to functional programming in ITB curriculum inspired me to study the functional programming paradigm with Scala programming language. This project intent is to develop lecture prototypes for a fictional "functional programming" module. The secondary aim was to deliver the lectures to potential students by means of simple web application developed using Play! Framework.
